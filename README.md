# BusTrackr

BusTrackr is a single-page application that informs users of the current status of a WMATA bus for every route. Users have the option of bookmarking routes and stops.

## Getting Started
Bus positions are updated every 15 seconds

You can search for a route of your own in the search bar (Autocomplete-enabled)

Create an account or log in to enable the bookmarking feature. 
See bookmarked lines by clicking "View your saved lines"

See which buses are on the road with "View active buses"

Use current location to center the map on where you are.

Click on a bus marker to see its destination, it's direction, and it's deviation from its schedule.
    Deviation: -1 means it's one minute early
    Deviation: -3 means it's three minutes late

Click on a stop marker to see which buses will visit that stop.
Here you can also see a prediction of how when the bus might arrive.
